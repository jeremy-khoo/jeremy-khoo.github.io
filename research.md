## Working Papers

1. on contractualist hostility to aggregation:
    > Contractualists want to avoid what they see as the unpalatable aggregative consequences of consequentialism. At the same time, they can't be completely indifferent to the numbers on pain of implausibility (*pace* [Taurek 1977](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2264945)). Can the contractualist thread this needle? I raise some worries, and explore some solutions.

2. on whether, according to Humean views of action, people can act for reasons:
    > Humeans claim that you act for a reason when your action is caused by a desire and a relevant means-end belief exercising their characteristic causal powers. Anti-Humeans claim that this misses something: namely that all action is *for* reasons, but one's behaviour could be caused by desires and beliefs without being *for* reasons, and therefore without being an action. [Schroeder 2006](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199299508.001.0001/acprof-9780199299508) argues that Humeans can overcome this problem by appealing to the attentional phenomenology of desire. I argue that Schroeder's proposed solution fails because it conflates two kinds of reasons.

3. on an animalist response to [Parfit's (2012) claim that we are not human beings](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/philosophy/article/we-are-not-human-beings1/D9289B6416C760FFBF81544ED9B57E5E):
    > Parfit argues that human animals think "derivatively", "by having a conscious thinking part which is a person in the Lockean sense", and also that we are not the derivative thinkers of our thoughts: that is, that we are not human animals. I argue that the animalist has a perfectly good response to Parfit that has all the virtues of his Lockean view when it comes to solving metaphysical problems about personhood: namely, it's not that my human animal thinks derivatively through me, but that I am derivatively a person through my "conscious thinking part which is a person in the Lockean sense". 

4. on the idea that democracy is 'intrinsically valuable':
    > I argue that contemporary democratic theory by and large has an inflated view of its own subject matter. We often hear that democracy is 'intrinsically valuable', but this either means, inspiringly but wrongly, that democracy is of fundamental value, or it means, rightly but mundanely, that democracy is valuable on account of its intrinsic properties. Though this mistake was [identified (in the general case) by Korsgaard (1983)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2184924) almost forty years ago, it still persists among democratic theorists.

## Current Projects

1. on the relationship between (what are normally called, though I dislike this way of putting it) normative and motivating reasons, and how agents can become ever more rational as this relationship improves
2. on the commonplace practice of claiming that non-communicative acts and their results (e.g. policies, practices, institutions) nevertheless have *meanings*, and the use of this idea in ethics and political philosophy
