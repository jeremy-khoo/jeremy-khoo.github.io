    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm Jeremy. I'm a graduate student in the <a href="https://philosophy.princeton.edu/">Department of Philosophy</a>, Princeton University. Before that, I spent three years at <a href="https://trin.cam.ac.uk">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where I also studied <a href="https://phil.cam.ac.uk">philosophy</a>. Before <i>that</i>, I spent more than 20 years on the sunny tropical island of Singapore, where I was born and raised.</p>
      <p>Most people get into philosophy by reading the Philosophical Canon, but the Philosophical Canon puts me to sleep. The book that made me think I might want to get into philosophy was Richard Joyce's <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/myth-of-morality/F2096BE68BB18274EF1DE01BB877AE4A"><i>The Myth of Morality</i></a>, which I first read when I was around 15. It was the first philosophical work I had ever read, and it made such an impression on me that for years after I would go out of my way to try and ape the way Richard did his references. I tried some of the Canonical stuff after that, but I quickly begged off after buying copies of Kant's first two critiques, which I promptly never read. (They did come in handy, many years later, when I had to deal with a large insect that had wandered into my bedroom.) To this day I remain firmly biased towards philosophy from the last 100 years, though I'm not particularly evangelical about this. My standard response to historical references, which I've had plenty of occasion to practise over the years, is to nod politely and pretend I know what you're talking about.</p>
      <p>My philosophical interests are broad but normatively-flavoured. A lot of my <a href="/research">work to date</a> has been at the interesection of meta-ethics and action theory and has to do with various questions about reasons. Aside from that, here's an alphabetically-sorted list of some of my interests: anti-natalism, contractualism and contractarianism, constructivism in meta-ethics, the dualism of practical reason, epistocratic alternatives to democracy, evolutionary debunking arguments, equality of opportunity and meritocracy, Nietzsche’s and Schopenhauer’s ethics, personal identity, the relationship between theoretical and practical rationality, semiotic arguments in ethics and political philosophy.</p>
      <p>When not doing philosophy I have been known to demonsrtate some skill at <a href="https://www.wespa.org/aardvark/html/players/1861.html">spelling words using plastic tiles</a>. I also like video games, symphonic metal, autumn, skiing, and hawker food from Singapore (Singaporeans are said to have only two pastimes, queuing and eating, and I'm not much for the former).</p>
