## Working Papers

1. on contractualist hostility to aggregation
    > Contractualists want to avoid what they see as the unpalatable aggregative consequences of consequentialism. At the same time, they can't be completely indifferent to the numbers on pain of implausibility (*pace* [Taurek 1977](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2264945)). Can the contractualist thread this needle? I raise some worries, and explore some solutions.

2. on whether, according to Humean views of action, people can act for reasons
    > Humeans claim that you act for a reason when your action is caused by a desire and a relevant means-end belief exercising their characteristic causal powers. Anti-Humeans claim that this misses something: namely that all action is *for* reasons, but one's behaviour could be caused by desires and beliefs without being *for* reasons, and therefore without being an action.
