# About
Hi! I'm Jeremy. I'm a graduate student in the [Department of Philosophy](https://philosophy.princeton.edu), Princeton University. Before this, I spent three years as an undergraduate reading [Philosophy](https://phil.cam.ac.uk) at [Trinity College, Cambridge](https://trin.cam.ac.uk). Before *that*, I spent more than 20 years on the sunny tropical island of Singapore, where I was born and raised.  

My philosophical interests are broad but normatively-flavoured. A lot of my [work to date](/research) has been at the interesection of meta-ethics and action theory and has to do with various questions about reasons. Aside from that, here's an alphabetically-sorted list of some of my interests: anti-natalism, contractualism and contractarianism, constructivism in meta-ethics, the dualism of practical reason, epistocratic alternatives to democracy, evolutionary debunking arguments, equality of opportunity and meritocracy, Nietzsche’s and Schopenhauer’s ethics, personal identity, the relationship between theoretical and practical rationality, semiotic arguments in ethics and political philosophy.
