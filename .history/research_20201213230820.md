## Working Papers

1. on contractualist hostility to aggregation
    > Contractualists want to avoid what they see as the unpalatable aggregative consequences of consequentialism. At the same time, they can't be completely indifferent to the numbers on pain of implausibility (*pace* [Taurek 1977](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2264945)). Can the contractualist thread this needle? I raise some worries, and explore some solutions.

2. on whether, according to Humean views of action, people can act for reasons
    > Humeans claim that you act for a reason when your action is caused by a desire and a relevant means-end belief exercising their characteristic causal powers. Anti-Humeans claim that this misses something: namely that all action is *for* reasons, but one's behaviour could be caused by desires and beliefs without being *for* reasons, and therefore without being an action.

I argue that Schroeder's proposed solution fails because it conflates two kinds of reasons.

3. on an animalist response to [Derek Parfit's claim that we are not human beings](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/philosophy/article/we-are-not-human-beings1/D9289B6416C760FFBF81544ED9B57E5E)
    > Parfit argues that

## Current Projects

1. on the relationship between (what are normally called, though I dislike this way of putting it) normative and motivating reasons, and how agents can become ever more rational as this relationship improves
2. on the commonplace practice of claiming that non-communicative acts and their results (e.g. policies, practices, institutions) nevertheless have *meanings*, and the use of this idea in ethics and political philosophy
3.
